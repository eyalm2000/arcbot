<h2 id="h_01J4Q87QTDPGRGJSHQP75HNE2F">July 11, 2024</h2>
<p>v.1.10.0</p>
<p>Thanks for using Arc! We have a new version for you, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introducing <strong><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/19335160678679" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arc Max</a>,</strong> our suite of AI-powered features designed to power up your browsing 🌸 <br><br>This week, we're excited to launch two new Max features:
<ul>
<li>
<strong><a href="https://resources.arc.net/hc/en-us/articles/19335160678679-Arc-Max-Boost-Your-Browsing-with-AI#tidytabs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tidy Tabs</a>:</strong> Automatically organize your sidebar into clean categories with the "Tidy" button.</li>
<li>
<strong><a href="https://resources.arc.net/hc/en-us/articles/19335160678679-Arc-Max-Boost-Your-Browsing-with-AI#askonpage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ask on Page</a>:</strong> Use Control-F to ask Arc any question about the current page. You can turn AI features on or off in Arc Settings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Settings persistence:</strong> Thanks to a member report, we fixed an issue where settings weren't persisted across restarts of Arc. Appreciate you!</li>
<li>
<strong>Command Bar:</strong> We've removed the scroll bar from the Command Bar for a cleaner UI and to fix a common bug.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h_01J4Q87QTD5Z0PZYG57MZB656K">June 27, 2024</h2>
<p>v.1.8.0</p>
<p>Thanks for using Arc! We have a new version for you, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Live Calendars for Windows:</strong> Now, when Google Calendar is pinned as a favorite in your Sidebar, you'll see a countdown timer in the calendar icon. Also, when it's time for the meeting to start, a "Join" button will automatically appear in your Sidebar, allowing you to jump into your next video call with one click. To change your Live Calendar's updates, just right-click the calendar icon and adjust its settings. Huge shoutout to Ben, Connor, and Freddy for bringing your Sidebar to life with this feature!</li>
<li>
<strong>Window Loading Performance Improvement:</strong> Alexandra has enhanced window loading performance by delaying the title bar display until the window is ready, resulting in a faster and more responsive interface.</li>
<li>
<strong>Translation Button Reliability Fix:</strong> Previously, there was an issue where the Translate button was not reliably responsive in certain cases. Thanks to Brian, this issue has been resolved, ensuring translations happen seamlessly each time.</li>
<li>
<strong>Bug Fix for Window Restoration After Restart:</strong> Thanks to Sherry, we have fixed an issue where, upon restarting, Arc would restore a temporary window that made it difficult to access spaces and pinned tabs. Now, we restore a full window with each restart, along with the temporary one if that was the last one closed.</li>
<li>
<strong>Small Design Polish for Account Settings:</strong> Alexandra has added some tiny-but-mighty design polish to account settings, making all widths of setting menus consistent for a more streamlined appearance.</li>
<li>
<strong>Longstanding Tab Closing Fix:</strong> Thanks to Seb, Adam, and Maya, we've fixed a longstanding issue that caused tabs to be archived ahead of your specified "Archive tabs after..." setting — improving tab management reliability.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h_01J4Q87QTDNZY0RWQYKSRC3GK5">June 20, 2024</h2>
<p>v.1.7.1</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Recall for Maximized Window States:</strong> Thanks to Alexandra, Arc now remembers if your window was maximized, allowing its size and position to be restored immediately when it’s reopened.</li>
<li>
<strong>Toggling Peek Feature:</strong> You can now turn the Peek feature on or off in Settings. This allows for two specific adjustments: toggling Peek when clicking links in pinned tabs and Favorites, and disabling Peek when holding “Shift” while clicking a link. To make these changes, navigate to Arc &gt; Settings &gt; General, and toggle the respective Peek options as needed. Kudos to Fabrice for making this possible.</li>
<li>
<strong>Bug Fix for Task Switcher Icons:</strong> Steve has fixed an issue where the Arc icon was missing from the task switcher (activated with Alt + Tab) and was incorrectly replaced with Windows’ default “no icon available” symbol. Now, when using the task switcher, the Arc icon will appear correctly.</li>
<li>
<strong>Automatic Page Translation:</strong> Thanks to Brian, Arc now offers translation if a website is not in your default language. If you’re on a page in a language other than your default, just find the globe icon in the top right corner, click “Translate” in the dialog box, and you’re all set.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h_01J4Q87QTDTJHA5ADGTS4A4XGA">June 13, 2024</h2>
<p>v.1.6.1</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Increased Tab Switching Speed:</strong> Thanks to Seb’s refactoring of tab logic, we’ve significantly increased the speed at which members can switch between tabs. By reducing the amount of work required for tab switching, we’ve made the process much faster and flicker-free — especially for devices with lower processing power.</li>
<li>
<strong>Account Management Updates:</strong> You can now easily update your name and email address, or delete your account, right from Arc’s Settings menu. Just find the Arc logo in the top left corner, navigate to “Settings,” click “Edit Account,” and make any adjustments you need. Shoutout to Alexandra for this major update!</li>
<li>
<strong>Improved Window Restoration Performance:</strong> Scott resolved an issue where, in some cases, the Arc window would not open after authentication. This should result in a more reliable and faster window restoration process.</li>
<li>
<strong>Staggered New Windows:</strong> Thanks to Alexandra’s handiwork, new windows now open slightly staggered from one another, rather than directly on top of each other, making them easier to view and click.</li>
<li>
<strong>Improved Favicon Visibility for Synced Tabs:</strong> Thanks to Andrzej’s improvements on favicon caching for pinned tabs that are synced across mobile and desktop. Now, for synced devices, pinned tabs should appear on desktop with a visible green dot favicon.</li>
<li>
<strong>Increased Reliability of Sync Toggle Settings:</strong> Props to Andrzej for also increasing the reliability of our sync toggle settings, ensuring that syncing across devices persists after the feature is initiated.&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<strong>Functional Top Bar Buttons:</strong> Alexandra fixed a bug that caused the top bar buttons to be unresponsive. They are now fully functional and ready to use.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h_01J4Q87QTD55E89ZA02JQ2K1DQ">June 06, 2024</h2>
<p>v.1.5.0</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>GitHub Live Folders</strong>: We’re introducing GitHub Live Folders that automatically compile and organize PRs. To get started, create a Pull Request, and let Arc magically create a new folder called “Pull Requests.” Watch your Live Folder stay up-to-date automatically, compiling PRs as they’re created and clearing them out once they’re completed. For a more tailored view, right-click on the Live Folder to filter and configure as needed. Big thanks to Freddy and Connor for making this happen!</li>
<li>
<strong>Audio Player Integration for Mini Player:</strong> Thanks to Alexandra, if you have a video playing in the Mini Player (Picture-in-Picture) and dismiss it by clicking the X, the video will be dismissed but the audio can still be played in the Sidebar Audio Player. This is perfect for moments when you just need the audio from a video playing in the background, such as YouTube podcasts, video lectures, and more.</li>
<li>
<strong>Peek Tab Dismissal:</strong> You can now dismiss a Peek tab using the Esc key. Kudos to Miko for this convenient update.</li>
<li>
<strong>Print Dialog Dismissal</strong>: Thanks to Miko, you can also use the Esc key to dismiss Print dialogs.</li>
<li>
<strong>Enhanced Drag and Drop Support</strong>: We’ve added support for more drag-and-drop data formats. Due to Miko’s work, you can now do things like drag and drop links into your Sidebar, downloads from the Sidebar library (bottom left corner), and songs into a Spotify playlist.</li>
<li>
<strong>Pinned Tab Dragging Issue:</strong> Alexandra fixed an issue where dragging a Pinned Tab out of your Sidebar to create a new window would not result in the tab being selected in the new window.</li>
<li>
<strong>Accessibility Updates</strong>: The UI elements and web contents now provide more information in accessibility tools such as Accessibility Insights and Inspect.exe. Kudos to Miko for prioritizing accessibility.</li>
<li>
<strong>Unexpected Space Focus Switch:</strong> Thanks to Darin, we’ve resolved an issue where selecting a tab in one Space would switch focus to another Space unexpectedly.</li>
<li>
<strong>Extension Popup Size Issue</strong>: Miko fixed an issue that caused extension popups to display at an incorrect size.</li>
<li>
<strong>Google Pay Functionality</strong>: With help from Mark, we fixed an issue that prevented Google Pay from working as expected.</li>
<li>
<strong>Dev Tools Cloning Fix</strong>: Thanks to Alexandra, we resolved an issue where undocked dev tools would recursively clone if two or more dev tools windows are opened.</li>
<li>
<strong>Dev Tools ‘F12’ Fix</strong>: Miko’s handiwork helped us fix a crash triggered holding F12 when dev tools are open.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h_01J4Q87QTD2GC5Y7NZK0HR652P">
<br><br>May 23, 2024</h2>
<p>v.1.3.3</p>
<ul>
<li>We’ve added the <a href="https://resources.arc.net/hc/en-us/articles/19234766331799-Mini-Player-Watch-or-Listen-as-you-Browse#audioplayer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Audio Player</a>! Click away from any tab playing audio and you’ll notice a small audio controller appear at the bottom of your Sidebar. To remove the Audio Player from your sidebar, simply click the "X" or close button on the controller.</li>
<li>We’ve added vertical Split Views! To create a Vertical Split you click the Split icon next to the minimize window control icon and select Add Top Split or Add Bottom Split. You can also create a vertical Split View from the Command Bar (Ctrl+T) and typing “add top split” or “add bottom split”.</li>
<li>You can now set an icon for your Spaces!
<ul>
<li>To change your Space icon, right click on your Space &gt; click ‘Change Space icon’ &gt; select an emoji.</li>
<li>To remove a Space icon, right click on your Space &gt; click ‘Change Space icon’ &gt; click the trash icon.</li>
<li>Space icons will Sync across your Arc installs on Windows and Mac.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can now use the back/forward buttons on your mouse to switch Spaces</li>
<li>You can now drag downloads from the Downloads menu (Ctrl+J) into web contents</li>
<li>You can now drag links from web contents into your Sidebar to create a new tab</li>
<li>We now automatically freeze background tabs that use too much CPU</li>
<li>We fixed an issue where Settings (Ctrl+,) would open behind the main Arc window</li>
